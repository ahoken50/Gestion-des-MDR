## 2024-05-23 - Insecure Firestore Rules
**Vulnerability:** Firestore rules for `counters` and `inventory` collections were set to `allow read, write: if true;`, allowing any user (even unauthenticated) to modify or delete all data.
**Learning:** Initial prototyping often leaves security rules wide open ("Test Mode"), which can persist into production if not audited.
**Prevention:** Always define schema validation and explicitly deny destructive actions (like `delete`) in Firestore rules from the start, even if authentication is not yet implemented. Use `request.resource.data` to validate input types.
